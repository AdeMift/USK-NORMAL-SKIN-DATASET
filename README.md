According to a report provided by the American Cancer Society, BCC is the most common type of skin disease in the United States. In Indonesia, BCC skin disease has been diagnosed since 1989 according to the Cancer Registration Agency of the Association of Indonesian Pathologists, namely 39.93% of 1,530 skin cancers in Indonesia. For this reason, a dataset of diseased and normal skin is required for the diagnosis made. It's just that, the skin image dataset that is published most often is the dataset for the sick class only. Meanwhile, datasets in normal or healthy classes are very difficult to find. In fact, if the dataset is widely published, research that will test by comparison of classes whether the skin is healthy or diseased will increase and facilitate the diagnosis process.

To classify normal and diseased skin, we use a deep learning approach. To achieve the best results, several CNN architectures such as ResNet34, VGG16, EfficientNet-b0, and EfficientNet-b0 are used to analyze the results. CNN is commonly used in the image processing and computer vision fields to recognize objects in images, classify image categories, and solve machine vision-related problems.

We also introduce a novel dataset called USK-NORMAL SKIN which comes from taking data from willing volunteers aged 
21-60 years on the face, back of the hands and forearms. Our goal is to address the unavailability of publications 
regarding normal skin datasets or healthy skin classes. This image data will be collected manually by taking pictures 
through a digital camera and collecting 170 images from 50 people, 25 male and 25 female. This dataset can be used for 
two tasks, namely classification and detection for normal skin classes that may be tested with diseased skin classes.

The tested architectures such as ResNet34, VGG16, EfficientNet-b0 and EfficientNet-b0 will be compared against each other. Each of these models has its own advantages in image classification. One thing these models have in common is that they are used for computer vision tasks, specifically the classification of images and objects. All of these models have proven successful in their tasks and are often used as benchmarks in computer vision research. The image size used has been modified to 224 x 224 pixels for all models tested from the original 600 x 450 pixels data.

| CATAGORIES     | Toral  | Dimensions |
